# Plotter Vision

This is a p5.js demo of hidden wire removal of 3D STL files
to generate SVG files that are suitable for plotting.
More info: [trmm.net/Hidden_Wireframe](https://trmm.net/Hidden_Wireframe/)

I'm not a javascript programmre, so this is probably not very well written.
Pull requests welcome!
